- redirect if not logged in

- read from json to dynamically load page (see already-written script elsewhere)
- CR
[N/A] html/css for see games ALL + see game (one)
[N/A] html/css for add teams to games (createGame?)
- test write JSON/delete JSON
[N/A] make classes(?) for each object type in the JSON?? some way to edit it idk smh
[N/A] apply some kind of css to the navbar, +100 points if it's the intended css

other js needed after crud established:
    [N/A] timer
    [N/A] game clearly needs more data in db or is it supposed to be stored locally? seems like a bad idea, ask gerald
    [N/A] anyway right now locally store ongoing games in some format
    - just add new game info as new json? seems to make more sense than deleting it each time

[N/A] [optional: fix bg loop]
